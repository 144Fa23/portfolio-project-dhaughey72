                <p>I was born in Grand Rapids, Michigan, and lived there for three years. Afterwards, I lived in Blythe, California, and Kotlik, Alaska, before moving to Maryville, Missouri. I have two cats named Milo (after Milo James Thatch) and O'Malley (the alley cat). I love both of them with all my heart. </p>
